    <Typography variant="h6" component="h6" gutterBottom>CODE OF CONDUCT.</Typography>
    <Typography variant="body1" gutterBottom paragraph>
      Violations of the following Code of Conduct will result in removal of content and ejection of offering users.
      Violations are reported by users or administrators and reviewed within 24 hours or less.
       </Typography>

    <Typography variant="h6" component="h6" gutterBottom>NO BULLYING.</Typography>
    <Typography variant="body1" gutterBottom paragraph>
      Koto is for sharing and belonging, not for attacking marginalized or vulnerable groups of people. Everyone has
      a right to use Koto free of harassment, bullying, and threats of violence. Users that incite violence or that
      promote hate based on identity or vulnerability will be ejected.
    </Typography>

    <Typography variant="h6" component="h6" gutterBottom>NO OBJECTIONABLE CONTENT.</Typography>
    <Typography variant="body1" gutterBottom paragraph>
      Do not post or encourage the posting of graphic, sexually-explicit, or offensive content.
    </Typography>

    <Typography variant="h6" component="h6" gutterBottom>NO HATE SPEECH.</Typography>
    <Typography variant="body1" gutterBottom paragraph>
      People that incite violence or that promote hate based on identity or vulnerability will be ejected. Marginalized or
      vulnerable groups include those based on actual and perceived race, color, religion, national origin, ethnicity,
      immigration status, gender, gender identity, sexual orientation, pregnancy, or disability. These include victims
      of a major violent event and their families. While the rule on hate protects such groups, it does not protect
      those who promote attacks of hate or who try to hide their hate in bad faith claims of discrimination.
    </Typography>

    <Typography variant="h6" component="h6" gutterBottom>NO THREATS.</Typography>
    <Typography variant="body1" gutterBottom paragraph>
      Do not threaten, advocate for, celebrate, or express extreme indifference towards any kind of action that results in or
      could result in death or harm (physical or otherwise). This rule applies to everyone. Users who engage in this
      behavior will be ejected.
    </Typography>

    <Typography variant="h6" component="h6" gutterBottom>NO TROLLING.</Typography>
    <Typography variant="body1" gutterBottom paragraph>
      Trolling of any kind is not allowed. Trolling is the act of commenting or submitting links with the intent to shock,
      anger, or sow discord without good faith. Good faith is sincere intention to be fair, open, and honest, regardless
      of the outcome of the interaction
    </Typography>

    <Typography variant="h6" component="h6" gutterBottom>NO BAITING.</Typography>
    <Typography variant="body1" gutterBottom paragraph>
      If you disagree with someone, don’t try to bait them into behavior that they would regret. If you think you are
      the victim of flaming or baiting, report them and move on. Don’t engage in personal attacks because someone is mistreating you.
    </Typography>

    <Typography variant="h6" component="h6" gutterBottom>NO PERSONAL ATTACKS.</Typography>
    <Typography variant="body1" gutterBottom paragraph>
      It doesn’t matter how “well-written” the comment, if your insult is sarcastic, “creative” or absurd, personal attacks are
      always against our rules. Name calling, ad-hominem, demeaning, inflammatory, or other uncivil comments directed at other
      users are not allowed. Users who break this rule may have their comment(s) removed and be warned and/or ejected.
