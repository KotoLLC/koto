You can sign up for Koto at [https://koto.at](https://koto.at). We've also launched apps for [iPhone](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/koto-social-network/id1530633715) and [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=koto.at&gl=AT).

**Dec 2020 - Feb 2021 update**: Koto is in alpha. When we launch, all pics and messages will be destroyed as we'll start anew. You can contact me if you want a .zip of your images. If you find a bug, file it [here](https://github.com/mreider/koto/issues). Also, please donate [here](https://gf.me/u/x738p6)! I've raised $2k, spent $4k, and my wife is grumpy (and lovely).

[Please refer to our docs for more info](https://docs.koto.at).
