# What's ahead

You can see what we have planned on our project roadmap [here](https://github.com/mreider/koto/projects/1). [Please consider donating to support the cause](https://gf.me/u/x738p6). 

## August 2020

- Ship the alpha version

## Future plans

We don't have anything planned yet, but there are a number of things we could do, in any order, depending on your feedback.

- **Reporting messages.** If someone is breaking the code of conduct, we should be able to report them, send it to the hub runner, and ban them from the user hub as well. [Issue 20](https://github.com/mreider/koto/issues/20), [Issue 19](https://github.com/mreider/koto/issues/19), [Issue 18](https://github.com/mreider/koto/issues/18)
- **Profile pages** with list of messages from your friend [Issue 25](https://github.com/mreider/koto/issues/25)
- Birthday congrats / emails. This is one of the things we like about FB. Birthdays are a time to get lots of love on Koto. [Issue 31](https://github.com/mreider/koto/issues/31)
-[Issue 21](https://github.com/mreider/koto/issues/21) We don't have a way to ban koto message hubs yet. If someone starts a hub, and breaks the code of conduct, we want to kill it. [Issue 22](https://github.com/mreider/koto/issues/22)
- **Deleting yourself.** If people want to leave Koto and erase all traces of themselves, they should be able to do that. [Issue 21](https://github.com/mreider/koto/issues/21)
- [Issue 21](https://github.com/mreider/koto/issues/21) Before someone deletes themselves, they should be able to download all the pictures, videos, and messages they have posted. [Issue 17](https://github.com/mreider/koto/issues/17)
- **Network page.** It would be cool to see a bubble / dot / anonymous visualization of hubs, relationships, to get a sense for the network, get statistics about it, and see how the whole thing is functioning. [Issue 8](https://github.com/mreider/koto/issues/8)
- **Cost estimator** A hub runner might like to know how much they are spending in storage fees (on Amazon, for example) based on the number of images uploaded every day.[Issue 9](https://github.com/mreider/koto/issues/9)
- **Rolling deletes**. An admin should be able to set rolling deletes to save storage fees. So maybe you choose to only keep the last 30 days of assets, for example. [Issue 10](https://github.com/mreider/koto/issues/10)
- **Rolling deletes**. An admin should be able to set rolling deletes to save storage fees. So maybe you choose to only keep the last 30 days of assets, for example.
~ **Koto on mobile**. With real notifications. [issue 101](https://github.com/mreider/koto/issues/101)
