## About Koto

Koto is a social network to share ideas, photos, and videos with friends. Koto's community agrees to a [code of conduct](conduct.md), which boils down to: **be kind**.

Koto is also distributed. This means we do not store your messages, photos, or videos on our servers. Instead, we store them on your - our member's - servers.

## Common Questions

### Why would I join Koto?

For the same reason you would join Facebook. To keep in touch with friends. But unlike Facebook, you'd prefer NOT to have:

- Advertising
- Behavioral tracking
- Bullying, bating, hate speech etc.

### What is a distributed social network?

Distributed social networks store their messages on servers all over the world. Normal people own and operate these servers because they want the network to succeed and prefer an alternative to Facebook or Twitter.

### Do I control where my messages, photos, and videos are stored?

Yes. When you join Koto, your messages are temporarily stored on the default message hub, where they only last for a week before disappearing. If you want permanent storage, you have a few options.

1. Find a friend with a message hub. You need to know their username or email address.
2. Host your own message hub on a server. There's a technical "how-to" on your profile page.
3. Send a note to admin@koto.at to request a sponsored message hub.

### What's a message hub?

It's where your messages are stored. Anyone can install a message hub for themselves and their friends.

### What if neither I, nor my friends, has a message hub?

Then you're stuck on the default message hub, where messages disappear a week after they're posted. Oh, and you also won't be able to create groups, which are a lot like Facebook groups.

### Is Koto's "feed" similar to Facebook's "news feed?"

Sort of. You and your friends can share with one another on Koto's feed, just like Facebook. But unlike Facebook these posts are never public to the Internet, nor viewable by anyone outside of your Koto friendships.

### Are Koto's groups similar to Facebook groups?

Sort of. There are two types of Koto groups: listed, and unlisted. Both are private, meaning that nobody can see any group messages unless they allowed in by the group's owner. Listed groups appear on the group list, where anyone can ask to join. Unlisted groups are invitation only.

### What are some other distributed social networks?

Some distributed social networks are comparable to Twitter. These include ([Mastadon](https://joinmastodon.org/), [Diaspora](https://diasporafoundation.org/), or [Steemit](https://steemit.com/). Others are more to Facebook, like [Minds](https://www.minds.com/).

### What makes Koto different?

It's different in two ways. First, Koto passes the "grandma test," which means your grandma can use it without feeling over-the-hill. Second, Koto's [code of conduct](conduct.md) does not allow bullying, objectionable content, hate speech, threats, trolling, baiting, nor personal attacks.

### Is Koto too boring and politically correct?

No. Let's look at Reddit as a good example of how to have fun with rules. Thousands of Gritty, sarcastic, and heated conversations take place on Reddit, yet many of their subs enforce these same rules. People can have fun without resorting to hate speech.
