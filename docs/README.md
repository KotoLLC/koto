## Introduction

I created Koto because I love using Facebook to keep in touch with friends, but hate what it's doing to us. The volume of disinformation on Facebook is staggering. Much of it is Russian state sponsored - designed to divide us and create chaos. It's working.

While Facebook has given this issue plenty of lip service - they refuse to make meaningful changes. It's simply too profitable to sell advertising against content that evokes anger and hatred.

As of early September Koto is functional, but there are plenty of little problems and quirks. We'll iron it all out over time.

## Comparison to other social network projects

Koto is unique among [social network sites](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_social_networking_websites) and [projects](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_social_networking_software), which seem to fall into one of four categories:

1. Failed (or failing) startups with no revenue
2. Commercial products that serve ads or charge a fee
3. Distributed OSS projects comparable to Twitter ([Mastadon](https://joinmastodon.org/), [Diaspora](https://diasporafoundation.org/), [Steemit](https://steemit.com/))
4. Centralized OSS projects comparable to Facebook ([Buddy Press](https://buddypress.org/)]

Koto blends these last two categories, offering both a distributed OSS approach, as well as more of a "closed circle" approach like Facebook.

*Note: [Minds](https://www.minds.com/) is a similar blend, but relies on Blockchain, and an incentive model for posting, which seem unnecesary to us.*

## How the social graph works

You can read about Koto's [social graph here](social-graph.md). It's almost identical to Facebook. Friends can post / see your timeline, but nobody else can.

## Who are you?

[I am a product manager with 30 years of experience](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mreider/) in the industry. I have been part of large software companies, and a few startups, one of which worked to measure Facebook video analytics. I am from Boston, lived in San Francisco for 20 years, and now live in Austria with my 2 kids and lovely wife. I work for Dynatrace and manage Koto in my spare time.
