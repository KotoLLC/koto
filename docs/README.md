## Introduction

Koto is an ad-free distributed social network.

Koto is comparable to Facebook, rather than Twitter, as it is for closed circles of friendships.

## Status

The alpha version is available. You can test it [here](https://koto.at)

## Comparison to other social network projects

Koto is unique among [social network sites](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_social_networking_websites) and [projects](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_social_networking_software), which seem to fall into one of four categories:

1. Failed (or failing) startups with no revenue
2. Commercial products that serve ads or charge a fee
3. Distributed OSS projects comparable to Twitter ([Mastadon](https://joinmastodon.org/), [Diaspora](https://diasporafoundation.org/), [Steemit](https://steemit.com/))
4. Centralized OSS projects comparable to Facebook ([Buddy Press](https://buddypress.org/)]

Koto blends these last two categories, offering both a distributed OSS approach, as well as more of a "closed circle" approach like Facebook.

*Note: [Minds](https://www.minds.com/) is a similar blend, but relies on Blockchain, and an incentive model for posting, which seem unnecesary to us.*

## How the social graph works

You can read about Koto's [social graph here](social-graph.md). It's almost identical to Facebook. Friends can post / see your timeline, but nobody else can.

## Our motivation

We want a functional alternative to Facebook that does not sell advertising or tolerate the distribution of lies to tilt elections, create chaos, encourage ignorance, and ruin civil discourse.

## Who are you?

[I am a product manager with 30 years of experience](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mreider/) in the industry. I have been part of large software companies, and a few startups, one of which worked to measure Facebook video analytics. I am from Boston, lived in San Francisco for 20 years, and now live in Austria with my 2 kids and lovely wife. I work for Dynatrace and manage Koto in my spare time.

## How you can help

There are a few ways you can help.

If you have some free time, I have all sorts of things you can do. Just get in touch via email at mreider at gmail dot com.

And of course, you can donate money. I am paying for a couple of engineers to help me, plus server costs, etc. You can donate [here](https://www.gofundme.com/f/byezuck).
