# Message hub registration

Interested in starting a message hub? 

Awesome! Here's how you do it.

1. Install the hub.

Choose a cloud provider (Digital Ocean, AWS, Google Cloud, Etc.) and follow the installation instructions [here](install-message-hub.md). You'll need to buy a certificate or use Let's Encrypt, as koto uses https to connect. You'll also need a fully qualified domain name.

1. Visit the hub registration page and enter either a domain name for your new message hub.

1. Write a compelling statement about how you will enforce koto's code of conduct.

1. The folks at koto.at (or the network you're using) will read your statement, and approve your message hub. Now you can post messages, along with all of your friends.
